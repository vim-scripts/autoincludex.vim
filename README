Place the cursor on the type you need to include. If it is your class,
for example MyClass, enter in Normal mode:
       :call AutoIncludeCC()
The string #include "myclass.h" will be inserted in file.
For type from library, for example STL, enter:
       :call AutoIncludeLib("stl")
 At first time you well be prompted to enter the correct header. You
should enter full text for include statement, i.e. with < >. In next
time this header will be inserted automatically even after reloading of   vim.
You can also place the special marks into file. For you types this is
the "project headers". In this case #include will be inserted after
line with this text:
   //project headers
   #include "myclass.h"
For type from the libraries this text is the "libname headers", where libname
is name of library:
   //stl headers
   #include <vector>

   //wx headers
   #include <wx/menu.h>

 Of course, you can create map for calling of this function:
map ;; :call AutoIncludeCC()<cr>
map ;;w :call AutoIncludeLib("wx")<cr>
